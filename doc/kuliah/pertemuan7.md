firewall is a system or device that allows network traffic that is considered safe for traffic through it and prevent an unsecured network. Generally, a firewall is implemented in a dedicated machine, which runs on the gate (gateway) between the local network and other networks. Firewalls are also commonly used to control access to anyone who has access to a private network from outside parties. Today, the term firewall becomes a generic term that refers to a system that manages the communication between two different networks.
